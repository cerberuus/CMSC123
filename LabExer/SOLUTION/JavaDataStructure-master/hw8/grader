Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  
  Why or why not?
  Not really, as my opionion, whether the mergesort is stable is dependent on the comparison, if we set this way:
  if I1 top item is small or equal to I2, then set top I1 into the list, thus we will get the stable mergesort. If 
  in the other way, we will get the unstable result.

  Is quicksort stable?  
  Why or why not?
  Yes, Since if we suffers the equal, we will use the queue(linkedList) to store the result, which FIFO, it is stable.
